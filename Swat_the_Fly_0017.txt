
A garden in the rear of a laboratory for animal experimentation. A
high red-brick wall encloses the garden, into which, at the upper
right-hand corner, juts the granite laboratory building. The interior
of the laboratory is brilliantly white. From it a door opens upon the
garden. Beside the door, hanging from a wrought-iron bracket, is a
globe in which are electric bulbs. The lights are turned on by pressing
a button in the framework of the door.

In the garden wall, at left, is a wide door leading to a city street.
In the rear wall is a square, window-like opening through which can be
seen the Horse’s standing-stall. The Monkey’s house is in the lower
right-hand corner of the garden. Directly across from it is the kennel
of the Dog. The Rabbit’s hutch is placed against the rear wall, close
to the square opening. The front of the hutch is screened with wire
netting._

_The garden is covered by a lawn. Flowers grow against its walls, as
well as in the corners made by the meeting of wall and building. Vines
climb the bricks on either side of the street door. Above the walls, on
every side, bend the branches of trees. At the center of the garden is
a low stone bench._

_It is late evening. The garden is only star-lit. Out of the gloom come
the sleepy bark of the Dog, the crunching and stamping of the Horse, as
he feeds, and the cross chatter of the Monkey. The tiny bell, which the
Cat wears on her collar, tinkles faintly._
